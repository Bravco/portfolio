The idea of a cow app was born in a coffee shop where a farmer friend of mine told me that he needed some kind of pregnancy monitoring for his cows.

As soon as I got home, I started developing a mobile app and a nodejs server to send cow status notifications to the user.

<br>

After I somewhat finished mobile development, I started building a website for it. The website is supposed to be a card file where all the information about the farm and the cows is located.

Unfortunately, the project was never fully completed due to the disadvantage of competition from the national agricultural enterprise of the Slovak Republic in the form of an app for farmers.
