The project's mobile side was built with the use of Flutter framework to target both Android and iOS users.

I used Firebase Cloud Messaging to send native mobile notifications and used nodejs to trigger the function every day at 8:00 AM (CEST). Maybe it wasn't the best way to do it, but it was the first time using scheduled notifications.

The website for the Cowlendar application was built as a Vue.js single page application. It connects to and functions with the Firebase database.

The Android app has been released on Google Play, you can download the app **[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mhbravco.cowlendar&pli=1)**. Hosting for the website is managed by GitHub Pages.
