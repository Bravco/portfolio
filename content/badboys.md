The BadBoys website was my one of my first experiences with semi-professional development and also my first uses of Nuxt.js framework.

Like a fool, I started developing the project without discussing it with the owner of the restaurant. He didn't even know that I was building it for his company. I just thought that I could make it and sell it with ease, but I was wrong.

When I finished the project I contacted the owner of BadBoys and to my surprise he didn't even want to see the finished product. I was devastated, but now I can at least learn from it.
