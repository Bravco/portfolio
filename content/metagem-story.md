A thought of metadata generator popped into my head when I finished building one of my website projects and I was faced with a task to improve its SEO. A non negotiable part of SEO are website's metadata.

I tried to look up some metadata generators, because I didn't want to think of my own descriptions or keywords. The internet showed me some basic generators, but none of them quite resonated with me.

As a passionate programmer I came up with the best possible idea. I will create my own metadata generator and it will be powered by AI. And this project is a reflection of my 3 week AI journey.
